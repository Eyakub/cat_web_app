### Create a code snippet
1. In VS Code, select the <b>File</b> (Windows/Linux) or Code (macOS), menu, then select <b>Preferences > User snippets</b>.

2. In the list that appears, select <b>html</b>. (The option may appear as "html.json" in the <b>Existing Snippets</b> section of the list if you've created snippets previously.)

3. After VS code opens <b>html.json</b>, add the code below within the existing curly braces. (The explanatory comments, not shown here, describe details such as how the `$0` line indicates where VS Code places the cursor after inserting a snippet):

4. Save the `html.json` file `(Ctrl+S)`.

5. Now, whenever you start typing the snippet's prefix, such as `djbaselayout`, VS Code provides the snippet as an autocomplete option, as shown in the next section. You can also use the <b>Insert Snippet</b> command to choose a snippet from a menu.
